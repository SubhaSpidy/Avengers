    <p>The Hulk is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby,
     the character first appeared in the debut issue of The Incredible Hulk (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character, who has 
     dissociative identity disorder (DID), is primarily represented by the alter ego Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid 
     possessing a limitless degree of physical strength, and the alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, 
     and emotionally reserved physicist, both of whom typically resent each other.</p>
     <p>Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays while saving the life of Rick Jones during the detonation of an experimental bomb, 
     Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will. This transformation often leads 
     to destructive rampages and to conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's level of strength is normally conveyed as 
     proportionate to his level of anger. Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk has been represented with other alter egos, from a 
     mindless, destructive force (War), to a brilliant warrior (World-Breaker), a self-hating protector (the Devil/Immortal), a genius scientist 
     in his own right (Doc Green), and a gangster</p>
     <p>Despite both Hulk and Banner's desire for solitude, the character has a large supporting cast. This includes Banner's love interest 
     Betty Ross, his best friend Rick Jones, his cousin She-Hulk, and therapist and ally Doc Samson. In addition, the Hulk alter ego has many 
     key supporting characters, like his co-founders of the superhero team the Avengers, his queen Caiera, fellow warriors Korg and Miek, and 
     sons Skaar and Hiro-Kala. However, his uncontrollable power has brought him into conflict with his fellow heroes and others. Despite this, 
     he tries his best to do what's right while battling villains such as the Leader, the Abomination, the Absorbing Man, and more.</p>
